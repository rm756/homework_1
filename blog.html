            <p>Hello there! I am a technology blogger. First let me tell you a little about myself. I am currently a 2nd year student at NJIT. I am a business and information systems major. I love to write and have always enjoyed reading about new technology so I decided to start a blog. One day I hope to be a full time blogger. I love to blog in my free time but I also love to read, workout, and try new restaurants. I hope that you will enjoy reading this blog as much as I love to write it. Also, make sure to subscribe below to never miss an update:)</p>
